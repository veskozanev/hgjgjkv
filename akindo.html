                                            <p>The present project was undertaken in collaboration with four other Web
                                                Design & Development students. As part of our 'User-centred
                                                Organisational Systems' module, we meticulously conducted user-centred
                                                research methods and conceptualized a platform based on our analysis.
                                                The project will present both my soft and hard skills in terms of
                                                teamwork, collaboration, organisation, design, research and testing.

                                            <h2>Data-gathering methods</h2>

                                            <p>Our approach involved a rigorous application of three data-gathering
                                                methods - <b>Questionnaires, Interviews, and Unmoderated Usability
                                                    testing </b>. The questionnaire was instrumental in providing us
                                                with
                                                critical insights into the anticipated platform features, as well as how
                                                other stakeholders, including University staff, IT staff, Alumni, and
                                                buyers, might potentially interact with the platform. By utilizing the
                                                questionnaire findings, we could enhance our low-fidelity sketches and
                                                incorporate new ideas into our features.
                                                <br> <br>Through the use of interviews,
                                                we were able to obtain in-depth information on users' experiences and
                                                expectations regarding the platform. Finally, we implemented
                                                high-fidelity wireframes and conducted usability testing to ascertain
                                                users' ability to navigate easily throughout the app.<b>Collectively,
                                                    these three methods helped us establish, improve, and upgrade our
                                                    project, ultimately culminating in an evidenced user-centred
                                                    organizational system.</b>
                                            </p>
                                            <h2>The team & my role</h2>

                                            <p>I was part of a team of five people - Junko Smith, Cristian Zennaro,
                                                Karolina Lencina, Catherine Campbell, and me. As for the roles, we
                                                decided that each would practice the methods to gain better insight and
                                                learn more about data gathering individually. However, there were tasks
                                                that each of us felt more comfortable doing and took responsibility for
                                                delivering them on time. For example, as I was most experienced in
                                                working with Figma, I took care of <b>the file organisation</b>, used
                                                the
                                                low-fidelity wireframes the team designed and turned them into
                                                <b>high-fidelity prototype</b> ones and <b>structured the Usability
                                                    testing.</b>
                                            </p>

                                            <h2>Organisation</h2>
                                            <p>As for the data gathering platform, we decided to use Figma because we
                                                could store all data formats easily. Additionally, we used Notion for
                                                task management and WhatsApp for non-verbal communication. We had
                                                meetings each Monday evening at Microsoft teams. During our team
                                                meetings, every member presented the work done during the weekend, gave
                                                each other’s feedback and then discussed the possible next steps.
                                                Additionally, we used the module's practical session on Friday to
                                                brainstorm, collaborate and analyse the research findings.</p>

                                            <br>

                                            <h2>Ideating & Voting</h2>
                                            <p>We decided that each of us needs to come up with 1-2 ideas for an
                                                organisational system until week 3. On our Monday meeting in week 4, we
                                                presented and discussed our ideas. I suggested the team to use a simple
                                                voting widget to visualise each member opinion. There were a couple
                                                ideas with the same voting, so we decided to use alignment scale widgets
                                                to see to what extend each of us likes the idea. As a result, we decided
                                                to work on the Creative Student Auction Platform concept that Junko
                                                suggested. We all agreed that it might be a challenging organisation
                                                system to research for, but it would help us enhance our soft and hard
                                                skills.</p>

                                            <p>In week 4, Catherine and I decided to create a research space where each
                                                member of the team would be able to put their findings on similar app
                                                layouts, colour palette, typography, design inspiration and low-fidelity
                                                wireframes. The team liked the idea and started filling their frames.

                                                research of how this can be done and created a password that will give

                                                        team, I realised that I made a questionnaire mainly for a

                                                        effort. The research helped me identify the questions that were

                                                        discussed that with the module lecturer and assistant, who
                                                        approved that decision.
                                                        We wanted to use the questionnaire insights to discuss further

                                                        In addition, I had to create and refine the mid-fidelity

                                                        The participant entered the meeting earlier, so we did a

                                                        One of the main insights was that <b>the users prefer to have a

                                                        thought direct observation would be the most suitable method for
                                                        testing the prototype. However, while reading the materials for
                                                        usability studies (week 9), I realised that <b>unmoderated
                                                            usability testing</b> would be the best option for us as two

                                                        team members were studying remotely. Hence, I suggested to
                                                        change our plan and use Maze to conduct the testing. While
                                                        discussing the third method with the module lecturer,
                                                        we realised we could do <b>moderated usability testing</b>
                                                        during our
                                                        practical. This plan would make us practice both types of
                                                        testing, gather responses from all potential users and be able

                                                        flows we wanted to test - purchasing a product, editing profile
                                                        information, requesting service, etc. Each of us had to turn our

                                                        analyse the findings. The testing would enable us to check if
                                                        the user experience is good and if the interface is

                                                        the screens. Consequently, we discussed the tasks and questions

                                                            size,

                                                        Additionally, we wanted to add task shuffling but unfortunately
                                                        Maze’s free plan did not offer it.
                                                        I took the initiative to polish and publish the test. Catherine
                                                        emailed the students who completed our questionnaire with the
                                                        testing link and instructions. We used one of our practical
                                                        classes to conduct moderated tests, enabling us to record the
                                                        screen and audio. We asked the participants to speak aloud so we
                                                        could afterwards understand easier their behaviour. At the end
                                                        of the testing, we discussed how they found the testing.</p>

                                                        The unmoderated (remote) testing saved us time and effort and
                                                        enabled us to test different types of stakeholders. However,<b>

                                                        On the contrary, <b>the moderated testing enabled us to ask
                                                            questions after the participant completed all tasks.</b>
                                                        Moreover,
                                                        we could record their mouse movement and voice, which helped us
                                                        analyse their behaviour. The disadvantage is that the moderated
                                                        one required more time to find participants and schedule the
                                                        sessions.
                                                        As for the research stages, I noticed that structuring the
                                                        usability testing is time-consuming and realised the importance
                                                        of piloting and proofreading.

                                                The app logo was created by Cristian. The logo forms the letter “A” of
                                                Akindo while recalling Japan for the origin of its name. It has white,
                                                red, and black colours, which are the colours of the Japanese flag as
                                                well as Napier logo, representing the relation of the app and the
                                                institution. Each member of the team really liked it, and we did not

                                                We decided on a colour scheme for our creative student mobile app
                                                platform that includes a primary accent colour and several neutral
                                                colours. The accent colour, #4F9A95, was chosen to draw attention to key
                                                areas of the app, such as the students' feed and creative works. The
                                                neutral colours, including #292929, #828282, #F2F2F2, and #FFFFFF, were
                                                chosen to provide a clean and modern aesthetic while also allowing the
                                                accent colour to stand out. By using a limited colour palette, we aimed
                                                to create a cohesive and consistent user experience throughout the app.
                                                Overall, this colour scheme was chosen to emphasize the importance of
                                                the students' creative works and provide a visually appealing and
                                                user-friendly platform for their expression..

                                                    During one of our online meetings, we discussed and created a list
                                                    with five main screens that each of us had to sketch. A week later,
                                                    we presented and discussed them. There were screens like
                                                    Notifications, User profile and Settings that we all designed in the
                                                    same direction. However, we had differences in the newsfeed and
                                                    marketplace screens. Additionally, the biggest challenge for us was
                                                    to identify our main sections and find their most appropriate place
                                                    to put them – side menu or navigation bar.

                                                The mid-fidelity wireframes were created by me. There were two
                                                discussions during our practical and online meeting when I presented
                                                them and received feedback. I refined some of the sections and created
                                                other needed ones. Catherine took the initiative to create the
                                                requesting service feature, which we also discussed together and
                                                refined. Overall, each member of the team was satisfied with the result
                                                and approved that it visualised everyone’s vision of the platform.

                                                building a high-fidelity prototype, designers can identify potential
                                                usability issues and make necessary adjustments before the final product
                                                is launched. This process helps to reduce costs and increase customer

                                            and hard-working individuals. Each of us contributed by giving ideas,
                                            researching, and presenting insights that made the overall process
                                            smooth and consistent. One of the things that I believe helped us
                                            deliver broad research was that we are all from different countries
                                            (Scotland, Italy, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and China), which gave us access

                                            where we critically reflected on each other’s work, which helped us
                                            learn and grow.We used our personal strengths like creativity,
                                            organisation, research, and communication to contribute to the project
                                            deliverables and took equal responsibility for the research methods.

                                            I enhanced crucial soft and
                                            hard like teamwork, organisation, time management and research. What I
                                            could do better was to practice my leadership skills and straight
                                            communication. I acknowledged that with good
                                            organisation and a hard-working team result in delivering the project
                                            objectives on time. The research experience showed me the most promising path
                                            to creating a user-centred design, which is to design with people, not
                                            for people by conducting research.
