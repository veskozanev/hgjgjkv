                  <h4>Iliyana has excelled with detailed research, iterative design and development</h4>
                  <p>Iliyana joined the Syrona Health team in May 2021 and has been integral to transforming the SORA
                    digital product from a standalone single-condition focused solution targeted at end-consumers to a
                    full enterprise solution spanning across multiple conditions which is currently being used by
                    thousands of users across Europe. <br>
                    Iliyana has particularly excelled with detailed research, iterative design and development. Iliyana
                    approaches a new project or sprint by taking a detailed approach researching utilising both primary
                    and secondary resources before moving into a design sprint. Iliyana truly embodies the brand and
                    keeps the end user when creating new designs. This has been echoed by our customers who have
                    commented on the ease of use of the SORA solution and the sleek design. Iliyana is a true team
                    player and ensures she involves relevant team members where needed in the product development cycle
                    ensuring a streamlined development process.
                    <br>
                    Itâ€™s critical to iterate quickly in a startup and Iliyana embodies this. Iliyana has been a true
                    asset to us at Syrona Health.

                  <h4>Her strengths include high attention to detail, planning and organisation</h4>
                  <p>My relationship with Iliyana Pirinska has been both professional and personal. We met at our first
                    year in university, in 2019, as we are classmates in the same programme - Web Design and
                    Development. On first impression, she
                    seemed really keen on learning new things, becoming more knowledgeable in her interests. She's
                    always struck me as a passionate individual when it comes to self-improvement.
                    Whilst in university, Iliyana and I have worked on a few group projects (related to HCI, User
                    Experience and Product Design).<br>
                    Her creative thinking and organisation add great value to team work. When participating in SoftUni
                    Fest (a design competition) as a duo, I got to experience Iliyana's professionalism and
                    resourcefulness. Her approach for research, preparation and organisation is one of the key aspects
                    of our competition success (we won first place).
                    <br>
                    Iliyana's best professional qualities include high attention to detail, extensive research, strong
                    planning and organisation. Since I've known her, Iliyana has immensely developed her communication
                    and team leadership skills. All that to say, I believe Iliyana is a strong individual as well as a
                    true team player!

                  <h4>Iliyana has been the smoothest team collaboration Iâ€™ve had in years</h4>
                  <p>Working with Iliyana has been the smoothest team collaboration Iâ€™ve had with a team member in
                    years. Her mind is rich in creativity and that alone helps the team jump out of any creative block
                    at the time. She is heavily detail oriented and a pro-level UX researcher. Her forte lies in user
                    testing, UX research, auditing, UI and accurate moodboarding.

                    <br>She is also a fast learner and eager to always keep herself and the team know about the latest
                    trends in the tech world as well as in the different platforms/software. Iliyana grasps the concept
                    of modern and user-centric design from the very start. Her dedication to the users is
                    astonishing and humbling. She designs for her users in the most respectful and comprehensive way possible. She has a good knowledge of code that enables her to
                    communicate smoothly with the developers as well.
                    <br>Iliyana is a hard worker by nature and is direct about her design choices. She confirms
                    relevance and researched proof behind her design preferences, which is very valuable to the
                    transparency and quality of the projects that come through. When times are rough for her ( as she is
                    multitasking work and university which is admirable in my eyes) she communicates well with the team
                    and manages to pull through with completing her tasks with a top-level delivery by the end of the day.
                    Iliyana is a punctual person and manages her time very well by using systematic tools like
                    checklists, and JIRA. Her voice and signature are very prominent in every project that launches and
                    I find that to be a well-preserved personalization of who she is as a designer in every
                    design-related deliverable.
                    <br>
                    Her enthusiasm to get the day started is refreshing and I personally find it a privilege to work by her side I am
                    confident that she will excel in her career in a very short period of time.
                    To whomever it may concern, Iliyana is a smart, reliable and kindhearted individual that will help
                    you bring out the best in you and your team. I highly recommend working with her in the future.
